# epidemic-protocols
Some epidemic protocols styles, implemented using Processing, coded for my bachelor thesis in Computer Science. You need processing 3.5.3 and this [library](https://github.com/ainter21/epidemic).
They were written as exercises for high school students and they were used during a 7 hour course. There are the solution of the exercises: you can find more info at this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bo3BsPxvkHWEICgpwwHn5SHN1ak1Z3KA). It is all written in Italian.If you are interested you can contact me for further explanation.

## Anti Entropy Protocols

Three styles of epidemic protocols based on SI model: PUSH, PULL and PUSHPULL. White nodes are SUSCEPTIBLE nodes and colored nodes are INFECTED nodes.

## Rumor Mongering Protocols
Two combinations of rumor mongering protocols: Feedback-Counter and Blind-Coin. They are based on SIR model. SUSCEPTIBLE nodes are white, INFECTED nodes are red and REMOVED nodes are GREEN.
